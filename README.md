# ChainForge

**Transparent humanitarian aid delivery, powered by Stellar.**

ChainForge is an open-source platform that combines on-chain escrow, off-chain AI verification, and field-ready mobile tools to deliver humanitarian aid directly to recipients — with full transparency from funding to final disbursement.

Built on the Stellar ecosystem (Soroban smart contracts), ChainForge ensures every aid package is traceable, every claim is verifiable, and every disbursement is auditable.

## Why ChainForge

Humanitarian aid distribution faces three persistent challenges: **lack of transparency**, **fraudulent claims**, and **inefficient disbursement**. ChainForge addresses all three:

- **Transparency** — Every aid package, claim, and disbursement is recorded on-chain via Soroban smart contracts, creating an immutable audit trail.
- **Verification** — AI-powered document analysis, proof-of-life checks, fraud detection, and PII anonymization ensure claims are legitimate before disbursement.
- **Field readiness** — Mobile apps with QR scanning and offline support let field operators verify recipients and process claims in remote areas.

## Architecture

The platform is composed of five distinct services:

| Service | Stack | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Smart Contracts** | Rust + Soroban | On-chain escrow, claim, and disbursement logic |
| **Backend** | NestJS + Prisma | API orchestration, persistence, role-based access |
| **Frontend** | Next.js + Tailwind | Admin dashboard, campaign management, reporting |
| **Mobile** | Expo + WalletConnect | Field operations, QR scanning, recipient flows |
| **AI Service** | FastAPI + Pydantic | OCR, anonymization, fraud detection, humanitarian verification |

## Core capabilities

### On-chain escrow
- Create, claim, disburse, revoke, and refund aid packages via Soroban contracts
- Indexer-friendly events for transparency and analytics
- Testnet guardrails to prevent cross-network mismatches

### AI-powered verification
- Document OCR and field extraction from uploaded evidence
- Proof-of-life analysis with facial matching
- Fraud detection and duplicate claim checking
- PII anonymization before external LLM processing

### Operational tooling
- Campaign management with review workflows and status tracking
- Role-based access control for administrators, operators, and auditors
- Webhook notifications for task completion and status updates
- Observability hooks with Prometheus metrics and structured logging

### Field operations
- QR-based package scanning for quick recipient identification
- WalletConnect v2 integration for secure Stellar wallet connections
- Offline-capable claim submission with background sync
- Real-time system health monitoring

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.11+
- Rust toolchain with Soroban CLI
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)

### Quick start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ChainForgee/ChainForge.git
cd ChainForge

# Start the backend
cd app/backend
npm ci && cp .env.example .env
npm run prisma:migrate && npm run start:dev

# In a new terminal — start the frontend
cd app/frontend
pnpm install && cp .env.example .env.local
pnpm dev

# In a new terminal — start the AI service
cd app/ai-service
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

See the individual service READMEs for detailed setup instructions and configuration guides.
